# Automatic Washing Machine Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates a washing machine using **PicsimLab**, aimed at replicating real-world functionality, including power control, program selection, water level setting, and washing operations. It provides hands-on experience in **embedded systems** and **automation** using microcontroller-based simulations.

## Features

- **Power ON and OFF:**
  - Simulation begins with a Power ON option controlled by the user through a switch.

- **Washing Program Selection:**
  - Various washing modes such as Daily, Heavy, Delicates, Whites, and more are available for selection.

- **Water Level Selection:**
  - Users can choose the water level from options like Auto, Low, Medium, High, and Max.

- **Start/Stop Control:**
  - Users can start and stop the washing machine operation, and the remaining time for each operation (wash, rinse, spin) is displayed.

- **Door Status Monitoring:**
  - The door status is monitored, and the machine only operates if the door is closed.

- **Program Completion:**
  - Upon completing the selected washing cycle, the machine displays a "Program completed" message and prompts users to remove clothes.

## Functional Requirements

- **Power ON Screen:** Displays Power ON message and waits for user input.
- **Washing Program Screen:** Allows users to navigate and select washing modes.
- **Water Level Screen:** Allows users to select water levels.
- **Start Screen:** Provides options to start or stop the washing machine.
- **Function Screen:** Displays the current function (wash, rinse, spin) and the remaining time.
- **Completion Status:** Notifies the user once the washing cycle is complete.

## Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller:** PIC16F877A
- **Software Tools:** PicsimLab, MPLAB X IDE
- **Programming Language:** C

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  
   ```

2. Open the project in **MPLAB X IDE**.

3. Run the simulation using **PicsimLab**.

## Conclusion

The washing machine simulation is an excellent educational tool that bridges theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience in embedded systems. It provides a solid foundation for further exploration in **automation** and **control systems**.
