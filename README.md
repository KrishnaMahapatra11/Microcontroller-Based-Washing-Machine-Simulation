Microcontroller-Based-Washing-Machine-Simulation
Project Overview
This project simulates a washing machine using PicsimLab, aimed at replicating real-world functionality, including power control, program selection, water level setting, and washing operations. It provides hands-on experience in embedded systems and automation using microcontroller-based simulations.

Features
Power ON and OFF:

Simulation begins with a Power ON option controlled by the user through a switch.
Washing Program Selection:

Various washing modes such as Daily, Heavy, Delicates, Whites, and more are available for selection.
Water Level Selection:

Users can choose the water level from options like Auto, Low, Medium, High, and Max.
Start/Stop Control:

Users can start and stop the washing machine operation, and the remaining time for each operation (wash, rinse, spin) is displayed.
Door Status Monitoring:

The door status is monitored, and the machine only operates if the door is closed.
Program Completion:

Upon completing the selected washing cycle, the machine displays a "Program completed" message and prompts users to remove clothes.
Functional Requirements
Power ON Screen: Displays Power ON message and waits for user input.
Washing Program Screen: Allows users to navigate and select washing modes.
Water Level Screen: Allows users to select water levels.
Start Screen: Provides options to start or stop the washing machine.
Function Screen: Displays the current function (wash, rinse, spin) and the remaining time.
Completion Status: Notifies the user once the washing cycle is complete.
